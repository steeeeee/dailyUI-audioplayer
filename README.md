# Little React/Redux AudioPlayer
React/Redux practice using ideas from Daily UI Challenge Mailing List.  
This audioplayer is styled following this Ted Kulakevich outstanding design on [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/3195031-Daft-punk)

Base: [Simple Redux Boilerplate](https://github.com/tsaiDavid/simple-redux-boilerplate)

### Roadmap

 - [x] Quick version on [CodePen](http://codepen.io/steeeeee/pen/XMGgvx)
 - [x] Layout data structure in a redux dev env
 - [ ] Move and refactor components following the redux paradigm
 - [ ] Implement Audio Player with static data, quick n dirty
 - [ ] Implement REST APIs (ie. SoundCloud)
 - [ ] Plan other features (favs, bookmarks...)

## Usage
##### Getting Started:

Install required dependencies.
(*Did you make sure you have the right version of Node?*)
```bash
npm install
```

Run development server, complete with DevTools and related configuration.
```bash
npm run dev
```

You're now ready to get working! *(enter command or visit via browser directly)*.
```bash
open http://localhost:3000/
```

If you wish not to free your system *3000* port. Then just pass the port of your wish/available.
```bash
npm start --port=3003
```
```bash
open http://localhost:3003/
```
