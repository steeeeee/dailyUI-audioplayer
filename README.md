# Little React/Redux AudioPlayer
React/Redux practice using ideas from Daily UI Challenge Mailing List.  
This audioplayer is styled following this Ted Kulakevich outstanding design on [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/3195031-Daft-punk)

Base: [Simple Redux Boilerplate](https://github.com/tsaiDavid/simple-redux-boilerplate)



### Roadmap

 - [x] Quick version on [CodePen](http://codepen.io/steeeeee/pen/XMGgvx)
 - [x] Begin transporting it into a redux dev env
 - [ ] Implement Audio Player with static data, quick n dirty
 - [ ] Implement REST APIs (ie. SoundCloud)
 - [ ] Plan other features (favs, bookmarks...)
